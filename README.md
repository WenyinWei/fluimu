# Mantaflow #

Mantaflow is an open-source framework targeted at fluid simulation research in Computer Graphics.
Its parallelized C++ solver core, python scene definition interface and plugin system allow for quickly prototyping and testing new algorithms. 

In addition, it provides a toolbox of examples for deep learning experiments with fluids. E.g., it contains examples
how to build convolutional neural network setups in conjunction with the [tensorflow framework](https://www.tensorflow.org).

## How to write a python scene file

### Set solver params

How much of resolution the simulation need to operate?

### Prepare grids

Prepare grids for:

- flags?
- velocity()
- density()
- pressure()

### Set noise field

### Set source

### GUI

Do we need to open GUI? If so, show the GUI.

### Start main loop
